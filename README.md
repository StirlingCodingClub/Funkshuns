# Funkshuns

__How to write our own__
 
 ## Aims
 
__Primary__

Anyone who has never before written a function should shoul get enough to able to give it a go

__Secondary__

Discuss how functions work in R and place them in a wider context of the programming environment

We scratched the surface a little on some important ideas such as how to know if you should write a function, what a function should do and how to store your creations for use across several scripts.
 
## Challenges

At the end of the workshop I proposed a couple of challenges for the keen (or the procrastinators)...

### Easier
Write a function that will calculate intercept and slope coefficients from two sets of coordinates
ie Rise / Run  
  input would be: __c(x1, y1), c(x2, y2)__

### Harder

Write a function that will partition an integer into its units, tens, hundreds etc  
E.g for an input of &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; __123__  
   the output would be: &emsp;&emsp; __100 &emsp;&emsp; 20 &emsp;&emsp; 3__

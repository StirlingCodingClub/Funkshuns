# What is a function?

Any given input should lead to the same output

# What is a function?

### Guess the function

_(could be none, any or all)_

> 1. &emsp; mean
> 1. &emsp; mean()
> 1. &emsp; (
> 1. &emsp; `+`
> 1. &emsp; :
> 1. &emsp; dplyr
> 1. &emsp; 42
> 1. &emsp; NA
> 1. &emsp; 'a'
> 1. &emsp; A
> 1. &emsp; `A <- mean`

# `is.function`

```{r}
is.function(`(`)
sapply(c(mean, `(`, `+`, `:`, 42, 'A', `for`, NaN, Inf, NA),
       is.function)
```

### `+` is a function?

```{r}
`+`(10, 20)
```


# In `R` __everything__ is a function

Most are followed by `()`

#### How to get info on an existing function

Enter a function name, without parenthises...

# Reasons to write your own functions

+ DRY code
  + reduce repetition
+ Reusability
  + within and across scripts or projects
+ Readability
  + Self documenting code
  + There are only two __hard things__ in Computer Science: cache invalidation and __naming things__
+ To make problem solving / debugging easier
+ Housekeeping
  + partitioning
  + separates definition from implementation
  
# When should you write a function?

+ All the time!

# When not to write a function

When someone else already wrote it!

\> 13,000 packages on CRAN + loads more on Github etc

Trade off between time spent looking vs writing

# How

### Anatomy

Functions have 3 parts

+ `formals` = arguments
+ `body`
+ (`environment`)

```{r eval=FALSE}
read.csv(file, header = TRUE, sep = ",", quote = "\"",
         dec = ".", fill = TRUE, comment.char = "", ...) {
  
  # BODY
    # csv reading code goes here...

}
```

![][advR-cover]

# Crappy example

```{r}
x_plus_x <- function(x) {
  
  x + x
  
}

x_plus_x(10)
```

# Better example

### SEM

There is no in-built function for calculating the standard error of the mean...

__SEM = standard deviation divided by sample size $= \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$__

Write the SE function...

```{r eval=FALSE}
stderr <- function(???) {
  
  ??????
    
}
```

# One more

$$y = a + \beta x$$

# Stuff

# How much work should a function do?

One thing!

If you have a complex task to perform, break it into smaller tasks.  
Write a function for each sub-task

Makes debugging easier

One return value  
...but `summary()`?

```{r}
summary(lm(dist ~ speed, cars))
```


# Environments

Each function has its own environment  
Objects created in a functions environment are not available outside this environment  
Watch out for global variables / "magic numbers"


# What to do with your functions in a scripts

+ Define all functions at the very start of a script
  + fine for a small number of short functions
  + only used within a single script
+ Save all functions in a separate script eg funcs.R
  + use `source('funcs.R')
+ Write a package...


# Challenge?

>- Write a function that will calculate intercept and slope coefficients from two sets of coordinates
>- ie $\frac{Rise}{Run}$  
input would be c(x1, y1), c(x2, y2)

<br><br><br><br>

>- Harder

>- Write a function that will partition an integer into its units, tens, hundreds etc
>- E.g for an input of &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; 123  
   the output would be: &emsp;&emsp; 100 &emsp;&emsp; 20 &emsp;&emsp; 3
